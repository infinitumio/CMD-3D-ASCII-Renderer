# Screenshots

This directory contains demo images and screenshots of the 3D ASCII Cube Renderer.

## Planned Screenshots

- `demo.png` - Main renderer in action
- `cube_close.png` - Close-up view of the cube
- `floor_grid.png` - Floor grid perspective
- `controls.png` - Controls demonstration

## Contributing Screenshots

If you'd like to contribute screenshots:

1. Take high-quality screenshots in different terminals
2. Show various angles and perspectives
3. Include different operating systems if possible
4. Ensure screenshots are clear and well-lit
5. Use PNG format for best quality

## ASCII Art Demo

Here's what the cube looks like in ASCII:

```
     #-------#
    /|      /|
   #-------# |
   | |     | |
   | #-----|-#
   |/      |/
   #-------#
```

*Note: Actual rendering is much more detailed with proper 3D projection!*
